  abstract = {The Mosquitia ecosystem of Honduras occupies the fulcrum between the American continents and as such constitutes a critical region for understanding past patterns of socio-political development and interaction. Heavy vegetation, rugged topography, and remoteness have limited scientific investigation. This paper presents prehistoric patterns of settlement and landuse for a critical valley within the Mosquitia derived from airborne LiDAR scanning and field investigation. We show that (i) though today the valley is a wilderness it was densely inhabited in the past; (ii) that this population was organized into a three-tiered system composed of 19 settlements dominated by a city; and, (iii) that this occupation was embedded within a human engineered landscape. We also add to a growing body of literature that demonstrates the utility of LiDAR as means for rapid cultural assessments in undocumented regions for analysis and conservation. Our ultimate hope is for our work to promote protections to safeguard the unique and critically endangered Mosquitia ecosystem and other similar areas in need of preservation.},

  abstract = {An important measurable indicator of urbanization and its environmental implications has been identified as the urban impervious surface. It presents a strategy based on three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs) for extracting urbanization from the LiDAR datasets using deep learning technology. Various 3D CNN parameters are tested to see how they affect impervious surface extraction. For urban impervious surface delineation, this study investigates the synergistic integration of multiple remote sensing datasets of Azad Kashmir, State of Pakistan, to alleviate the restrictions imposed by single sensor data. Overall accuracy was greater than 95\% and overall kappa value was greater than 90\% in our suggested 3D CNN approach, which shows tremendous promise for impervious surface extraction. Because it uses multiscale convolutional processes to combine spatial and spectral information and texture and feature maps, we discovered that our proposed 3D CNN approach makes better use of urbanization than the commonly utilized pixel-based support vector machine classifier. In the fast-growing big data era, image analysis presents significant obstacles, yet our proposed 3D CNNs will effectively extract more urban impervious surfaces.},

  abstract = {The optimization of forest management in the surroundings of roads is a necessary task in term of wildfire prevention and the mitigation of their effects. One of the reasons why a forest fire spreads is the presence of contiguous flammable material, both horizontally and vertically and, thus, vegetation management becomes essential in preventive actions. This work presents a methodology to detect the continuity of vegetation based on aerial Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds, in combination with point cloud processing techniques. Horizontal continuity is determined by calculating Cover Canopy Fraction (CCF). The results obtained show 50\% of shrubs presence and 33\% of trees presence in the selected case of study, with an error of 5.71\%. Regarding vertical continuity, a forest structure composed of a single stratum represents 81\% of the zone. In addition, the vegetation located in areas around the roads were mapped, taking into consideration the distances established in the applicable law. Analyses show that risky areas range from a total of 0.12 ha in a 2 m buffer and 0.48 ha in a 10 m buffer, representing a 2.4\% and 9.5\% of the total study area, respectively.},

  abstract = {The terrain slope is one of the most important surface characteristics for quantifying the Earth surface processes. Space-borne LiDAR sensors have produced high-accuracy and large-area terrain measurement within the footprint. However, rigorous procedures are required to accurately estimate the terrain slope especially within the large footprint since the estimated slope is likely affected by footprint size, shape, orientation, and terrain aspect. Therefore, based on multiple available datasets, we explored the performance of a proposed terrain slope estimation model over several study sites and various footprint shapes. The terrain slopes were derived from the ICESAT/GLAS waveform data by the proposed method and five other methods in this study. Compared with five other methods, the proposed method considered the influence of footprint shape, orientation, and terrain aspect on the terrain slope estimation. Validation against the airborne LiDAR measurements showed that the proposed method performed better than five other methods (R2 = 0.829, increased by \textasciitilde 0.07, RMSE = 3.596°, reduced by \textasciitilde 0.6°, n = 858). In addition, more statistics indicated that the proposed method significantly improved the terrain slope estimation accuracy in high-relief region (RMSE = 5.180°, reduced by \textasciitilde 1.8°, n = 218) or in the footprint with a great eccentricity (RMSE = 3.421°, reduced by \textasciitilde 1.1°, n = 313). Therefore, from these experiments, we concluded that this terrain slope estimation approach was beneficial for different terrains and various footprint shapes in practice and the improvement of estimated accuracy was distinctly related with the terrain slope and footprint eccentricity.},
